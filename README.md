## ✨ Features
- 🏞️ **Image Classification**: Classifies satellite images into various terrain categories (e.g., urban, forest, water bodies).
- 🚀 **Transfer Learning**: Leverages pre-trained models to accelerate training and improve accuracy.
- 🤖 **Ensemble Learning**: Combines predictions from multiple models for robust classification.
- 🌍 **Geospatial Data Processing**: Utilizes image processing techniques tailored for satellite data.

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prathyushlebaku7/Satellite_image_classification.git
    cd Satellite_image_classification
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then, install the required packages with:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(If there is no `requirements.txt`, manually install necessary packages such as `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `opencv-python`, and `matplotlib`.)*

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    - Open `Satellite_Image_Classification_new(1).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook Satellite_Image_Classification_new(1).ipynb
      ```
    - The notebook demonstrates transfer learning and ensemble learning techniques for classifying satellite images. Follow the steps to preprocess images, train models, and combine model predictions.

2. **Preprocess and Train the Model**:
    - Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess satellite images, apply transfer learning from pre-trained models, and use ensemble learning to boost classification accuracy.

3. **Classify New Images**:
    - Use the trained model ensemble to classify new satellite images. You can modify the notebook to add new images or deploy the ensemble model in a separate script.
